There are many who would count me amongst designers, I am not one of those people. I work with desiners, I can see a good design from a bad one... but I am no designer. This is probably why after years of trying to make a fancy blog, something noteworthy, something catchy to the eye--- I opted instead to bring something simple to the board. <!--more--> Something that would bring what a blog is most needed for, it's content.

Thus I present to the world, my personal blog I. Am. Carrico. A little blog of the musings of a web developer, aerialist, libertine and dubious philosopher. Build upon [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with some lovely [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and compass magic tossed in... it is a simple, easy place for you to find my thoughts.

If you are interested in the tools I used to build such a place, check out the [Github repo](https://github.com/ChinggizKhan/grunt-poole) I built from the lessons I learned here. It has a grunt template that contains a jekyll site, compass plugins and some magic with compass. It is a good starting point for anybody wanting to learn more about these awesome tools. I will write more soon about deployment and how to use grunt to make you life immesensely easier.
