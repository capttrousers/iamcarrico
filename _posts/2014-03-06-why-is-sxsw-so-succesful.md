Every year, thousands of people come to Austin, TX for the annual [SXSW festival](http://sxsw.com/). And each year it sets record numbers of participants and partygoers that attend. What drives droves of people from across the globe to the city for SXSW? The event is so large, that there is not a single reason behind its success, but many. Here are a few I find compelling.

## Anything can happen

From [impromptu concerts by Jack White](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx7yky2C9Gk), to [Twitter's launch](http://laughingsquid.com/twitter-wins-sxsw-web-award/), and even [Bill Murray serving tequila](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwwEGjGbxXM)--- anything can happen at SXSW. My favorite encouter was a few years back, where I was able to be [Jeffrey Zeldman's](http://www.zeldman.com/) impromptu "Sherpa" prior to his presentation. I have met many of my industry's movers and shakers, as well as some of the [more](http://ronenv.com/) [interesting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermin_Supreme) [people](https://twitter.com/timoreilly) in the world. In short, you never know what is going to happen any day of the festival. It is just important to keep your eyes and ears open in order to be ready for what the day might bring.

## Austin's weather

Mid-March in Austin usually comes with temperate climate. Excluding a few years, the weather has been bright and warm. It is a great time to get out of the seasonably cold weather of the north to enjoy some good southern sun. Even this year, with Austin's varying weather in March, it is looking like the week will be quite beautiful overall.

## Amazing content

Every year [Hugh Forrest](https://twitter.com/Hugh_W_Forrest), [Shawn O'Keefe](https://twitter.com/shawnokeefe) and the rest of the SXSW Interactive team bring in some of the best speakers across the globe. With these speakers comes not just amazing content, but also sparks great conversation. SXSW stems new and interesting ideas at every turn. I spend most of the week thinking about what the year is going to bring and what new ideas I can apply to my current project.

The interactive content is not even a third of what SXSW has to offer. The festival also has film, featuring amazing content from talented film makers from across the globe. SXSWedu has already begun. They have been sharing innovations across the world of education. Of course, the foundation of SXSW is the music. This where huge artists, rising stars, and international groups come together and fill Austins streets, parks and bars with music.

## Parties, parties everywhere

I have two rules for SXSW, do not pay for your drinks (but tip your bartender) and do not wait to get into an event. Luckily, there are so many event's across the city, there is always an event ready to meet and greet new people. Certainly, Austinites love the free events that come with SXSW, and I could not agree more. Just remember to RSVP to the events you want to go to, and do not be afraid to find the smaller events all over the city. Some of the bests nights I have had were at hole in the walls on the east side!

## An adventure on every corner

So to all of you coming to Austin, welcome! Take in all that the city and SXSW have to offer this week. For those who are not able to join this year, see what you an online and be apart of the conversations. I look forward to seeing what SXSW has in store, and what new innovations (and bands) come out of it.
