[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) has for a long time allowed free, easy, and hassel-free hosting on GitHub. It can be as simple as creating a ```gh-pages``` branch in a repository, and pushing that to GitHub. Or, for a more complete solution, [Gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/) can be used to build, minfiy, concatenate, and publish a Jekyll site. By using Gulp, there is the option of using other Jekyll extensions, and improving the workflow in the process.
