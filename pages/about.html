  <h1>Who is this man?</h1>
  <p>Ian was born long ago in a land known for its red dirt. Fast-forward a few years, and he found himself in Austin&mdash; the proud city-state within the proud nation-state of Texas. He spent his college years learning Spanish and Mandarin, with a few other phrases from other languages here and there. When he wasn't behind a book, he was learning the fine art of cocktail making, and the less fine art of imbibing the same cocktails.</p>
  <p>After college, he found himself working for Intel, building and developing an internal Drupal installation. He then work for SicolaMartin, as their developer and occasional jester. During this time, he learned much about the more intricate parts of backend web development. Following work in advertising, he moved to Four Kitchens as we Web Chef. There he specialized in the backend of front end development, spending much of his time developing backend tools for front end developers to utilize.</p>
  <p>Currently Ian is at Vox Media as a Web Performance Artist, making the web a little faster every day. For updates on what he is working on, check out his GitHub page or continue to follow this blog.</p>
  <p>While not coding or writing, you can find him practicing Corde Lisse or possibly conversing the many wonderful people Austin holds. At night you can find him at a number of fine, or less fine, establishments across Austin&mdash; learning what he can from the friendly man on the other side of the counter.</p>
