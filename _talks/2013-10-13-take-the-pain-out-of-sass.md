Managing multiple projects, multiple developers, or different development environments on a project makes Sass quickly go from an awesome tool to a painful test in debugging. But it does not have to be this way! There are tools, and methods to quickly and easily manage each individual project to use consistent versions of Ruby, the proper gems, and deploy code in an easy and consistent manner.

This workshop will show you how to utilize rbenv, bundler, and grunt.js to create a simple and easy workflow for your team. It is guaranteed to take the pain out of the Sass development process, and allow your developers to do what they do best: develop.
