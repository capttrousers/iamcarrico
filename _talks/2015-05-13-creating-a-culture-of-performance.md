We have all been on a project that we want to be perfect. We work strenuously on the design, take extra care with our development, all towards the goal of creating a fantastic site for our users. However, as we are finishing up the project, we notice that the site is loading slower than anticipatedâ€” the frontend is not performant.

This session goes over what it takes to consider performance at every step of the process, from design to deployment. Creating a performance budget, testing for your users, and having accurate information for developers and designers are all important to create this culture. We will go over the Continuous Integration (CI) tools available to get important performance data from your site, test each change before it gets merged in, and make the data available to the entire team.
