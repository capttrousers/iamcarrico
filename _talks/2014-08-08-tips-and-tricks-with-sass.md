Lets be honest, ruby is hard. It breaks, it has weird errors, it requires specific versions of its gems, and just makes me want to scream. And that makes using Sass even more difficult. How can we get our frontend developers using this amazing tool? Once we have it running, what are the best practices to ensure our code is DRY as possible?

This session will go over the tools, such as rbenv and bundler, needed to keep our ruby environment stays clean. We will then go over what best practices are with Sass, and common mistakes we have all made at one point or another. Finally, we will briefly go over the best tools available to make the most of your new Sassy project.
